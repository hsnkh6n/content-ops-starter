        What need is there to speak your heart to everyone?
        I never truly learned what it means to love someone
        At times, I weep when new seasons unfold,
        At times, I go searching for friendships of old.

      *When I saw her eyes I was transfixed*

      *They are like two cups of wine that are ablaze*

      *Are these eyes? or the two doors of wine-house*

      *Do I call them eyes or a part of my dreams*

      When lowered, they turned into modesty, pure and shy;

      When lifted, they rose like a prayer to the sky.

      When they rose, then dipped—they became a graceful art;

      When they dipped, then rose—they struck like a punishment.

      *Eyes, in which the sky and earth are captured*

      Narcissus-like beauty, lined in smoky haze.

      It's not possible to praise the beauty of my beloved
